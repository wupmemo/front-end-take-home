# { "appName": "Portal" }

Portal is a simple ReactJS App running on Docker Containers for convience and ease of both development and deployment.

### App components

- Since the focus on this Task is on the froentend I will be mocking the Backend by simply providing a JSON response from `json-server` package using a simple `db.json` file. two database entities will be modeled as:

1. Product
2. User

- Docker will be used to enable developers to work easily in development time by simple command like `docker-compose up --build` to build both the App and the database servers.
